Hello, my name is Logan! I am a student at the University of Minnesota planning on pursuing computer science. Most of my coding experience comes from games I've published on Roblox written in Luau, but I have some experience (primarily academic) with Python, Java, and JavaScript as well.

My Roblox Games can be found here: https://www.roblox.com/communities/12237610/Zumprer-Studios
I like to post updates on my progress/creations here: https://x.com/zumprer
